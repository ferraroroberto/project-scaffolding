"""
Streamlit log panels
====================
UI-side renderers for the in-memory ring buffer that ``src/logger.py``
fills. They live under ``app/`` because they import ``streamlit``, which the
UI-import boundary keeps out of ``src/`` (ruff ``TID251``, see
``docs/streamlit-conventions.md``).

In a Streamlit page that runs a pipeline:

    from app.log_panel import stream_to_streamlit

    stream_to_streamlit(lambda: run_my_pipeline())

The pipeline runs on a background thread while the same log lines
stream live into a panel inside the page — and into the terminal.

    """Run ``work()`` while streaming its log output into a live panel.

    ``work`` is executed on a background thread so the calling (script-run)
    thread stays free to repaint the panel ~``1/poll_seconds`` times a second.
    Streamlit UI calls must happen on the script thread, so it is the *work*
    that moves off-thread, not the painting — the panel therefore scrolls live
    while ``work`` runs, then settles on the final buffer. This is the single
    canonical "stream logs into a live Streamlit panel" implementation; pages
    should call it rather than hand-rolling their own refresh loop.

    Usage::

        stream_to_streamlit(lambda: example_pipeline.run(steps=12))

    Returns whatever ``work()`` returns. Any exception raised inside ``work``
    propagates out of this call after the final repaint, exactly as if it had
    run inline on the calling thread.
