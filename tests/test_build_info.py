"""``src/build_info.py`` — the process-identity helper (#199, #246, #247).

Exercises the failure-degrades-to-"unknown" contract directly, and the
retry-inside-the-capture behaviour #246/#825 depend on: a transient failure
must not freeze "unknown" for the process's whole life, and a successful
capture must pay nothing extra.
