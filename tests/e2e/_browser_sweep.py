"""Post-run sweep for leaked Playwright browser helper processes (issue #203).

The companion to `docs/playwright-ui-testing.md`'s "Bounded WebKit driver
teardown" watchdog. That watchdog protects the *current* run's exit path from
a *pre-existing* wedge; it does nothing about browser **child** processes
(`WebKitNetworkProcess.exe` and siblings) that outlive the run. This module is
the missing half: after the session ends, look for helper processes that
belong to *this* checkout and are genuinely orphaned, and tree-kill them.

Three findings shape the design — read them before changing anything here:

1. **An exit code is not an exit. Classify before killing, but do not read
   "exited" off `GetExitCodeProcess` alone.** #203 measured every "orphan" on
   the fleet host reporting `GetExitCodeProcess` == 0 and concluded they had
   all exited cleanly. Windows *does* keep a genuinely-exited process's object
   (and its row in `tasklist` / `Win32_Process` / bulk `Get-Process`) alive
   until the last handle to it closes, so a real *zombie* looks exactly like a
   live orphan to a name-based scan: unkillable (`taskkill` and `Stop-Process`
   correctly answer "no such process"), holding no sockets, and harmless.
   That much held. What did not is the inverse inference — #236 measured 39
   such helpers on `home-automation`'s host (`home-automation#681`) where
   `GetExitCodeProcess` said `0` but `GetProcessTimes` reported **no exit
   time**, Toolhelp32 reported a **live thread**, `ReadProcessMemory` on the
   PEB **succeeded**, and the working directory was a real worktree path.
   Those are processes **wedged inside termination**: `ExitStatus` is set, so
   every Win32 accessor answers "gone", but a thread never finished dying and
   the **cwd handle is still held**. They are unkillable *and* still pinning a
   directory — the one state that makes `git worktree remove` fail as "busy",
   and precisely the state the old `exited -> VERDICT_ZOMBIE` shortcut
   swallowed before cwd was ever consulted. Six empty, undeletable worktrees
   accumulated over four days while the sweep reported `zombie=39` and exited
   green. So liveness is a **tri-state plus unknown** (`STATE_RUNNING` /
   `STATE_EXITED` / `STATE_WEDGED` / `STATE_UNKNOWN`, see `liveness`), a wedged
   helper gets its cwd read and its own verdict, and only a genuinely-exited
   one is a `zombie`.
2. **Never kill by name.** A kill needs three independent facts: the process
   is really running, its parent is dead (a *live* parent means a legitimate
   in-flight session — an agent's headed verification loop, a sibling job),
   and its working directory is under the scope path this run owns. Anything
   the sweep cannot establish gets its own verdict, never folded into
   "killed" or "clean" — the same rule as the fleet's shared-Chrome-profile
   and safe-restart conventions: never kill a live holder.
3. **Reporting a wedge is all this module can do about one — the fix is
   upstream.** Nothing can reap a process wedged mid-exit, so a sweep that
   *sees* one still cannot free the directory it pins. The actual remedy is to
   stop helpers rooting in the checkout at all: start the Playwright driver
   from a neutral cwd (`tests/e2e/conftest.py`'s `_neutral_driver_cwd`), and a
   wedged helper then pins `%TEMP%` instead of a worktree. For a pin already on
   disk, the cwd handle can be closed remotely
   (`NtDuplicateObject(..., DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE)`) — see
   `docs/playwright-ui-testing.md`; rebooting the host is *not* the remedy.

Working directory is what attributes a helper back to the checkout that
spawned it: helpers inherit the pytest process's cwd, so a run inside
`…/repo-wt-203` leaves helpers whose cwd is `…/repo-wt-203` — which is also
why such a leak blocks `git worktree remove`. There is no Win32 accessor for
another process's cwd, so `_read_process_cwd` walks the PEB via
`NtQueryInformationProcess` + `ReadProcessMemory`. That reach is best-effort
by design and degrades to `None` (verdict `skipped:cwd-unknown`, no kill).

Vendorable in the same shape as `tests/e2e/_e2e_live_guard.py` and
`tests/e2e/_geometry.py`: the scope path is the only call-site argument, so a
byte-identical copy never forks. Stdlib only. Non-Windows platforms get an
honest `supported=False` result rather than a false "nothing to clean".
