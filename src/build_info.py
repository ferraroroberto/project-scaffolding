"""Process build identity — the git SHA this process actually loaded (#199, #246, #247).

Captured once, at import time, so it reflects the code running in *this*
process rather than live git state: a process started three days ago still
reports the SHA it booted with, even if ``HEAD`` has since moved. That is the
whole point — the "Restart/deploy coverage" convention in this repo's
``CLAUDE.md`` compares a process's captured identity against the repo's
current ``HEAD`` to decide whether a merged change actually shipped, and a
helper that re-resolved live would make every process report "fresh" no
matter what it is actually running.

**Retries a failed resolution inside the capture, never after it.** A single
transient ``git`` failure at import used to freeze ``"unknown"`` for a
process's entire life (observed: 8 days, ``app-launcher#825``). The retry
happens within :func:`build_identity` itself, in the first second of start,
so the "captured at my own start" semantic holds; a later re-resolve would
let a stale process report a newer ``HEAD`` as a confident "fresh" — strictly
worse than ``"unknown"``. A genuinely broken resolution (no ``git``, not a
repo) still yields ``"unknown"`` rather than a guess.

Vendor-verbatim: consuming apps copy this file byte-identical into their own
``src/`` (like ``src/no_window.py``, ``src/pooled_http.py``) — the project
root is the only call-site argument, so the copy never forks. Self-contained
on purpose (no import of this repo's own ``src.no_window``): a byte-identical
copy dropped into another repo's tree must resolve on its own.
